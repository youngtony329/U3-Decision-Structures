    A Shipping Company charges the following rates
    for each 100 miles shipped:

    2lbs or less ..................... $1.10
    over 2lbs but less than 6lbs ..... $2.20
    over 6lbs but less than 10lbs .... $3.70
    over 10lbs ....................... $4.80

    Write a program to calculate the shipping price. The
    distance is not prorated, in other words, the price doesn't
    increase until the next 100 miles, i.e. 150 miles for a 3lbs
    package is still just $2.20.

    Example Run:
    Weight: 5.6lbs
    Distance: 345 miles
    Price: $6.60

    As always, your program should include a method.
